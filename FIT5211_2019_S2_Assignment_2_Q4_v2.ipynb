This step costs $O(1)$.\n","\n","The insertion operation costs $O(k\\log c) + O(k\\times (c+\\log c + 1)) + O(1)$. **Therefore, the time complexity in worst case is $O(k\\times c)$.**\n","\n","### Searching\n","Register keeps track of the occurence of each character and inter-connection between two adjacent characters. \n","Searching operation do the following steps iteratively and terminate when all characters are queried:\n","1. Register find the entry for current character. This operation cost $O(\\log c)$.\n","2. Register checks whether the occurence times for this character at this node is zero or not. This step costs $O(1)$.\n","3. If it is non-zero, back to the start and check the next character. If not, return `False`. This step costs $O(1)$.\n","\n","The worst case is when the string belongs to the register. It cost $O(k\\times (\\log c + 1 + 1))$. **Therefore, the time complexity in worst case is $O(k \\log c)$.**\n","\n","### Deleting\n","Before starting to delete the string, register confirms it contains this string, consuming $O(k\\log c)$. If it contains, register do the following steps:\n","1. Register find the entry for current character. This operation cost $O(\\log c)$.\n","2. Register checks whether the occurence times for this character at this node is zero or not. This step costs $O(1)$.\n","3. Decrease the occurence times for this character at this node by 1. If there is next character, back to step 1 for next character. Otherwise, return deletion result. $O(1)$.\n","\n","**The worst case for deletion is when the string belongs to the register, costing doubled $2k \\log c$. It is still in $O(k \\log c)$.**"]}]}
